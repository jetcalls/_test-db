Elias was an orphan, raised by the kind-hearted villagers who found him as a baby, swaddled in a royal blanket with a mysterious crest. Despite his humble upbringing, there was something undeniably special about him. Elias was curious and brave, always exploring the woods and helping those in need. He was loved by all for his compassion and courage. One day, while wandering deeper into the forest than he ever had before, Elias stumbled upon a hidden glade where an ancient oak tree stood, its branches heavy with golden leaves. As he approached the tree, a voice echoed through the glade. It was the voice of the Great Spirit of the Forest, who revealed to Elias that he was the last surviving heir to the kingdom of Eldoria. The kingdom had fallen into darkness after the treacherous usurper, Duke Malachar, seized the throne. The Great Spirit told Elias that it was his destiny to reclaim the throne and restore peace to Eldoria.",
